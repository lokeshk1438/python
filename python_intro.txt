python
	interpreted---runned at line by line and gvs the o/p
	high level
	object oriented---mainly uses objects to deal with.
	interactive
features 
	easy to learn--few keywords,simple structure
	easy to read--cleary defind n if well written then simple to read
	easy to maintain--source code is easy to maintain
	broad standard library--has bulk library and also compatible to all platforms
	interactive mode--asks input in between 
	portable--can run on any platform
	extendable--add multiples modules(programs) to it
	database aware--provides interfaces to all db's
	gui prog..
	cgi
	scalable
imp structural features
	built in high level data types: strings, lists, dictionaries
	if, ifelse, while, for(loops)
	used as a scripting lang
	supports automatic garbage collection
	easily integrated with other languages(c, java, cobra, c++)
no need to declatre
need to assign(initialise it before use)
case sensitive

basic data types:

numbers
int(signed int's) = C long precision
long -- unlimited precision
float --floating point real values
complex--complex numbers
	--immutable data types

	--operators
aithmetic operators
	//(truncation takes place) Floor Division -The division of operands
		 where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed
	1/2 == 0.5
	1//2 == 0
	** Exponent -Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators
bitwise operators
	~ -- complement(negation)
	& -- ANDing
	| -- ORing
	^ -- XORing
	<< --left shift
	>> right shift

	--functions
